# LaTeX, tutorial and templates on how to get started

The goal of this project is to condense my accumulated LaTeX code snippets into a short and comprehensible introduction for beginners.

Open the file "LaTeX-tutorial.pdf" and follow instructions to set up and learn how to work with LaTeX.

I'm happy to receive your feedback at:
