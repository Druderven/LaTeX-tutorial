% Hi there!

% This template can help you write an awesome report while focusing on its content ;-)

% Enjoy the clear beauty and structure of LaTex!
% Fadri Pestalozzi, 2015


% In order to compile a LaTex document, we first need to load some packages
\input{files/header/packages}

% Frequently used content (e.g. symbols, formulas, environments, ...) can be replaced by customized commands for more efficient writing
\input{files/header/customized_commands}

% After loading packages and defining commands, we can now start writing the actual document
\begin{document}

% To separate introductory content from bulk text, I like to start off using roman page numbering. The default page numbering uses arabic numbers.
\pagenumbering{roman}

% Let's start by creating a custom title page
\input{files/title_page}

% To continue on a fresh page after finishing the table of contents, break the page!
\pagebreak

\hypertarget{toc:label}{}  %second brackets could hold target text. 
%empty target label to refer to the table of contents

% Next off, we can create a table of contents. The LaTex "table of contents" is automatically hyperlinked to the content listed inside. After following a link inside the pdf, jump back using alt+ArrowKeyLeft
\tableofcontents

\pagebreak

% Switching back to arabic page numbering for the main text
\pagenumbering{arabic}

% Input individual chapters or even sections as separate .tex files for more clarity
\input{files/chapters/chapter-1}
\input{files/chapters/chapter-2}

% To gather acronyms or explain some technical mumbo jumbo, a nomenclature may come in handy :)
\input{files/nomenclature}

% The bibliography is usually put at the end of a report
\input{files/bibliography/include_references}

% To implement a custom bibliography style with the citations in order of appearance and allowing for urls, the file "unsrturl.bst" has to be located in the same folder as the main .tex-file (=in our case "report.tex").

%% template for a scientific report:

%\input{files/chapters/Results}
%\input{files/chapters/Discussion}
%\input{files/chapters/Conclusion}
%\input{files/chapters/Outlook}
%\input{files/bibliography/include_references}
%\input{files/chapters/Appendix}
