%===================================================================

% If a punctuation character like "." or "," follows a customized command, we need to omit the blank space otherwise necessary.
% To solve this dilemma we can introduce the d-form of any command, where no space is printed afterwards. "d" stands for "dot".

% As some very short commands like \g are reserved by LaTex, we can describe any unit by simply starting off with a "u".
